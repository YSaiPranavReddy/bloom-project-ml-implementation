# ðŸ§  Deep Learning from Mathematical First Principles

**Neural networks built entirely from scratch using pure NumPy - no TensorFlow, PyTorch, or autograd.**

This implementation demonstrates deep understanding of backpropagation mathematics, optimization theory, and numerical computing by building production-ready neural networks from the ground up.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Makes This Different

Most ML practitioners use high-level APIs without understanding the underlying mathematics. This project proves mastery by:

- **Im2col/Col2im convolution optimization** - Transforms 7-nested-loop convolution into matrix multiplication (~10x speedup)
- **Adam optimizer from scratch** - First & second moment estimation with bias correction, no framework dependencies
- **Custom data augmentation pipeline** - Manual implementation without ImageDataGenerator or tf.data
- **Production-level numerical stability** - Gradient clipping, weight normalization, label smoothing
